The AI engineer's work involved an iterative process of building and refining the ExpTek corporate consulting website, specifically focusing on the Finance Implementation service page. The initial setup included a modern homepage, dark mode, and various interactive components. The primary challenge during this trajectory was the development of the dedicated service page, which underwent several significant design and functionality iterations. Key challenges included addressing copyright concerns by replacing an SAP image with a custom roadmap, continuously refining the roadmap's layout (from initial custom design to tab-based, then accordion, and finally back to a horizontal interactive timeline with specific accordion-like details per phase), and meticulous design adjustments (layout, font sizes, spacing, and a custom logo). The engineer demonstrated a detail-oriented approach by incorporating specific design cues, ensuring mobile responsiveness, and handling numerous precise layout and styling corrections as requested by the user. The project is now poised to move to Phase 3 & 4 of the service page development, with Phase 1 & 2, including the interactive roadmap and custom logo, being complete and approved.
