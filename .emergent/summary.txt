The AI engineer has progressively built out the ExpTek corporate consulting website. Initially, the focus was on establishing a modern homepage, iterating on design elements, logo integration, and handling minor UI issues. The project then transitioned into two major phases: first, a detailed rebuild of the homepage according to explicit layout and style specifications, including responsive design; second, a significant expansion introducing dark mode, a theme toggle, and numerous advanced interactive sections like animated metrics, comparison tools, and an ROI calculator, all driven by JSON content. The engineer successfully implemented these, addressed compilation errors, and just commenced work on a comprehensive Finance Implementation service page, demonstrating an iterative, detail-oriented approach.

The goal is to build a modern, conversion-optimized corporate consulting website for ExpTek, an SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud Finance consulting company. The design must be agency-quality, featuring dark navy/blue gradients, SAP blue as primary, cyan accents, glassmorphic effects, and professional typography.

The application includes:
- **Phase 1: Core Website (Homepage)**: Sticky navigation with logo, tagline, horizontal menu (Home, Services, Case Studies, Insights, About, Contact) and a Book Consultation CTA. A hero section with a two-column layout, statistics cards with glassmorphic effects. A services section with showcase and detail cards, and a CTA section with a blue gradient background. A three-column footer.
- **Phase 2: Advanced Features & SEO**: Full dark mode support with a theme toggle, localStorage persistence, and smooth transitions. New interactive sections including Live Customer Success Metrics (animated counters), an ExpTek vs Big 4 Comparison Tool, Industry-Specific Solutions Showcase (filterable tabs), Client Testimonials Carousel, Interactive ROI Calculator, a Comprehensive Blog/Insights Hub, Resource Library, Live Chat Widget, Interactive Implementation Timeline, Certification & Partnership Badges, FAQ Accordion, Newsletter Signup, and a Multi-Step Contact Form. All dynamic content is to be managed via JSON files. Critical SEO optimization (meta tags, schema, performance, content, crawlability, accessibility) and analytics tracking preparation are required.
- **Current Task: Dedicated Service Page**: A comprehensive Finance Implementation - SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud service page, structured with a hero section, overview, detailed SAP Activate Methodology roadmap, interactive timeline, Fit-to-Standard workshop details, finance modules covered, integration capabilities, data migration approach, accelerators, case study spotlight, pricing models, Why Choose ExpTek section, team structure, risk mitigation, a dedicated FAQ, resources, and next steps CTA. This page also has specific design, interactive, and SEO requirements.

Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer received detailed specifications for a new dedicated service page: Finance Implementation - SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud. This page is intended to be comprehensive, covering the SAP Activate methodology, implementation phases (Discover, Prepare, Explore, Realize, Deploy, Run), Fit-to-Standard workshops, finance modules, integration capabilities, data migration, accelerators, a case study spotlight, pricing models, team structure, risk mitigation, and a dedicated FAQ section. It also includes specific design, interactive elements (like expandable phase details and timeline visualization), and extensive SEO requirements (meta information, schema markup, content, technical SEO). The AI engineer has just acknowledged this request and stated the intention to start building the page structure and content. No code changes for this specific page have been made yet, but the overall framework (header, footer, theme, main homepage) is in place to support its integration.
